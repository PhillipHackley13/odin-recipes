I'm writing this after completed my first HTML project. The goal of this project was to create the bare bones of a website. To create an index page, to create different recipe pages, and to link them back to the index page. Along with the goal above, this project demonstrates the use of different heading sizes, adding images to a page, the use of alt text for accessability, using paragraph tags, break tags,unordered lists, ordered lists, and combining each technique into a cohesive html site. This project also helped me to become more familiar with using git commands, git status, git log, git add, git commit -m"", git push origin main. Lastly this project helped me to better understand the importance of strong github documentation and how helpful it can be for my future self and anyone else that interacts with my code.
